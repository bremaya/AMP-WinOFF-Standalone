# AMP WinOFF Standalone

AMP WinOFF (http://ampsoft.net/utilities/WinOFF.php) is an utility for scheduling the shutdown of Windows computers, with several shutdown conditions and fully configurable.

This is a personal project, and I'm not related with Alberto Martínez Pérez (http://ampsoft.net) or PortableApps (https://portableapps.com).
Only unpack and enjoy (unpack in PortableApps folder to integrate with him).

This is packed with AMP WinOFF v5.0.1.
